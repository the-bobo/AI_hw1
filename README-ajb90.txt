(1) input file must be utf-8 encoded

(2) Exactly one argument required: must specify filename.txt of input file

(3) Correct usage is: node tilepuzajb90.js filename.txt

(4) filename.txt must also be in the same directory as tilepuzajb90.js

(5) you will need nodejs installed: Kubuntu should have it in apt-get (Ubuntu 14.04 does):
	Easy Install:
	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
